# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** All 35 MCP tools work reliably against real Velociraptor deployments with actionable output and graceful error handling
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Test Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Test Infrastructure)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-25 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 3.3 min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-test-infrastructure | 3 | 10min | 3.3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min, 4min, 3min
- Trend: Consistent velocity

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Test container first: Lower risk, faster iteration — validates infrastructure before physical deployments
- On-prem before cloud: Validate core functionality before platform-specific deployments
- Gap analysis over new features: Understand capability needs before building new tools

**From 01-01 execution:**
- Module-scoped fixture to prevent gRPC connection exhaustion
- Explicit connect/close calls for clear lifecycle management
- Autouse fixture for global client state reset between tests

**From 01-02 execution:**
- Best-effort cleanup: log warnings but don't fail tests if cleanup errors occur
- Function-scoped autouse fixture for cleanup: runs after every test to prevent pollution
- TEST- prefix convention: All test entities use TEST- prefix for easy identification

**From 01-03 execution:**
- Session-scoped target_registry to discover enrolled clients once per test session
- Autouse certificate check fixture fails fast before cryptic gRPC errors
- Graceful degradation when cryptography library unavailable
- OS-based capability inference (Linux, Windows, Darwin)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 consideration:** Windows container availability may require VM fallback or Windows testing deferral if winamd64/velociraptor-client image unavailable.

**Phase 6 consideration:** Physical lab or cloud VM infrastructure needed for deployment validation beyond Docker containers.
