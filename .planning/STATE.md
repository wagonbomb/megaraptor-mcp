## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Test container first: Lower risk, faster iteration — validates infrastructure before physical deployments
- On-prem before cloud: Validate core functionality before platform-specific deployments
- Gap analysis over new features: Understand capability needs before building new tools

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 consideration:** Windows container availability may require VM fallback or Windows testing deferral if winamd64/velociraptor-client image unavailable.

**Phase 6 consideration:** Physical lab or cloud VM infrastructure needed for deployment validation beyond Docker containers.
