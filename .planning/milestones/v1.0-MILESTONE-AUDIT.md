## E2E Flow Validation

### Flow 1: Investigation Workflow (DEPLOY-03)

**Status:** COMPLETE

```
TRIAGE (VQL query) → COLLECT (artifacts) → WAIT (flow completion) → ANALYZE (results)
```

File: `tests/integration/test_investigation_workflow_e2e.py`

### Flow 2: Deployment Lifecycle (DEPLOY-01, DEPLOY-04)

**Status:** COMPLETE

```
DEPLOY (create server) → HEALTH CHECK (wait healthy) → VERIFY (accessible) → DESTROY (cleanup)
```

File: `tests/integration/test_docker_deployment_e2e.py`

### Flow 3: Error Handling

**Status:** COMPLETE

```
INVALID INPUT → VALIDATION (validate_*) → STRUCTURED RESPONSE (error + hint)
```

Files: All `tools/*.py` files

## Tech Debt Summary

### Non-Blocking Items (5 items across 5 phases)

| Phase | Item | Priority | Action |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 01 | Subprocess-based container lifecycle | LOW | Document as intentional, pytest-docker optional |
| 02 | Stale VERIFICATION.md | LOW | Re-run verification or note gap closure fixed issues |
| 04 | Windows tests skip | N/A | Expected - tests ready when target added |
| 05 | Placeholder baselines | N/A | By design - live population workflow |
| 06 | Skip-guarded tests | N/A | Expected - tests ready when infra configured |

**Total:** 5 items, 0 blockers

## Critical Gaps Identified for v2

From GAP_ANALYSIS.md:

1. **Timeline generation tool** - DFIR essential for event sequencing
2. **IOC extraction tool** - Threat hunting essential
3. **Report generation tool** - Documentation essential
4. **File remediation tool** - Response capability

## Recommendations

1. **Complete milestone** - All requirements satisfied, no blockers
2. **Track tech debt** - 5 non-blocking items documented for backlog
3. **v2 priorities** - Address 4 critical tool gaps identified
4. **Cloud testing** - CLOUD-01/02/03 scoped for next milestone

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 Quality & Real-World Validation is READY FOR COMPLETION.**

- 39/39 requirements satisfied
- 6/6 phases verified
- 21/21 cross-phase connections working
- 3/3 E2E flows complete
- 0 critical gaps
- 5 non-blocking tech debt items documented
